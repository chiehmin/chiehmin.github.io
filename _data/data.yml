      company: Synology, Taipei
      details: |
        - Improved the services’ availability, maintainability and observability by refactoring the infrastructures
          using container orchestration framework (k8s), IaC (Ansible and k8s) and several monitoring tools
          (Elastic stack, Prometheus...etc).
        - Reduced the web request p99 latency of services running in a virtualized environment from 40s to 1s
          by adjusting the overcommited cpu and memory resources to a better allocation to reduce the VM
          memory page fault rate and CPU steal time. Improve the performance of service background workers
          by successfully scaling the workers to fully utilize the available CPU resources on the system.
        - Ensured the GDPR compliance of collected data by designing and implementing a data pipeline to
          make sure the data content align with the pre-defined schema. Improved the the data ingesting
          performance by identifying the bottlenecks and separating the stateless part and stateful part to
          scale-out the services.
        - Achieved 1,000 connection per second and 200,000 concurrent connections for the in-house traffic
          monitoring and deep packet inspection solution on the router platform with limited hardware resources
          by leveraging the Linux netfilter to design a flexible offloading framework.
